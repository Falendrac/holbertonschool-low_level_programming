# 0x14 bit manipulation

## General

In this project, we see how to manipulate bits. Using some operators, shifter and conversion.

## Requirement

For compiling:

> gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 [NAMEOFFILES.c] -o [NAMEFILE]

Ubuntu 20.04.

## Code source tasks

0. 0-binary_to_uint.c

    Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. 1-print_binary.c

    Function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2. 2-get_bit.c

    Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. 3-set_bit.c

    Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

4. 4-clear_bit.c

    Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. 5-flip_bits.c

    Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip
    to get from one number to another.
